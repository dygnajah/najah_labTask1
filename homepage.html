                                Humans are the most superior creatures amid all the creatures
                                 in the entire universe. Being a part of this universe
                                 <br>makes me feel small and minuscule in a world where there millions of<br>
                                 humans like myself. Although everyone is quite unique in their
                                 own way. I try my best to be humble, kind and respectful of everybody I
                                  meet regardless of their <br>age, gender, family background, nationality or race.
                                 It is not an easy task to <br>write about oneâ€™s self because one may<br>
                                  tend to either over exaggerate or fail to give succinct descriptions
                                 and commendations where necessary.
                                 <br> It is with this background that I introduce myself.
